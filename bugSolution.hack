```hack
function foo(x: int): int {
  return x + 1;
}

function bar(x: int): int {
  return foo(x) * 2;
}

function main(): int {
  $result = bar(5);
  echo $result;
  return $result;
}
```
This improved version uses explicit type declarations for all functions, including `main`, which now explicitly returns an integer value. This approach enhances code readability and consistency.  The explicit return in main also aligns with better programming practices in many other languages. The output is printed correctly, and the main function returns the result which provides better control and flexibility for a main function.  Using consistent style improves maintainability and makes it easier for other developers to understand the code.
