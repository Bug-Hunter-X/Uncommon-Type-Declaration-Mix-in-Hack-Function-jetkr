# Uncommon Type Declaration Mix in Hack Function

This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon type declaration mixing in Hack functions. While the code is functional, the inconsistent use of explicit and implicit type declarations can lead to confusion and reduced code readability.

The `bug.hack` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.hack` file offers a solution for improving the code's consistency and clarity.

The main objective here is to highlight the importance of maintaining consistency in type declaration style within a Hack codebase.
